# Readme

### 1. Overview 

This is very gentle introduction to Python Programming. The notebook in this repository introduces you to basic concepts such as variables, strings, dictionary, loops and other basic python concepts. You can download the whole folder and run it in your local machine. I will continue to update the resources below, and I hope that you will find it helpful: 

### 2. Learning Resources 

#### 2.1 Books and online tutorials* Introduction to Python Programming [LearnPython](https://www.learnpython.org)

* Seaborn for data visualisation [seaborn library](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* Plotly for data visualisation [Documentation and Examples](https://plotly.com/python/)
* Beautiful Soup library has great features for web scraping [Beutiful Soup](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/python-on-the-web/web-scraping-with-beautifulsoup)
* Get started with Github, first install gits [Install Gist](https://www.jcchouinard.com/install-git/), then you can watch this on how to use github at [Use Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE&t=518s)

### 3. Going Deeper into Data Science 

If you are considering digging deeper into the world of data science, machine learning and get more understanding of the underlying theories as well as developing good understanding of tools and techniques that I would recommend the following resources: 



1. **Machine Learning**: If you can commit some time every week (4 hours or so),I would highly recommend Andrew Ng Course on Coursera. It provides and excellent coverage of various machine learning methods, starting from simple linear regression all the way up to Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines [Coursera Course]( https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#syllabus). You can also watch the videos on YouTube if you prefer not to enrol in the course [YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN)

2. **Deep Learning**: The deep learning specialisaiton provided by Andrew Ng, is also one of the best and well-explained specialisations in this area, and it takes you one step deeper from Machine Learning course (above) [Deep Learning Course]( https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). Again, if you don't want to enrol in the course, you can watch the video lectures at [YouTube Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4cs9xVecg&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0)
3. A more hands on specialisation using TensorFlow, it is also provided by Coursera. Practical course, mostly focus on Keras [Coursera Course]( https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice#courses). 

4. **Machine Learning -Theory-**: Good coverage of theories and principles of machine learning and learning from data (more theoretical, but really useful): [Video Lectures](https://youtu.be/mbyG85GZ0PI)

### 4. Some Datasets to Use 

* UCI Repository, wide range of [Datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
* Good selection of datases [Here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/24-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/)
