# Readme

Although implementing the Neural Networks from scratch using Python is relatively an easy task, this repo will show you how to use **keras** to build your first neural network. 

It is assumed that you have installed Python, Anaconda, and Scikit-Learn, if not, you can use Google Colab.

Keras is a Deep Learning API that allows you to easily create, train and validate various Deep Learning Models. Full documentation for Keras can be found at [Here](https://keras.io/). The framework was built on top of Tensorflow (Google DL framework), and soon became very popular because of itâ€™s ease of use.

In order to be able to use Keras, you need to install the 'tensorflow' framework. This can be easily done using the 'pip install command', or you can follow the detailed instruction to install it using Anaconda if you are using it for the development [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/)
