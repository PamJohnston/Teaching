# Readme

Logistic Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning **classification** algorithm. We used it to predict the probability that an event will occur. The response variable (what we try to
predict), is a binary variable. In other words it has two classes (i.e.~pass/ fail). Often represented as 0 and 1 respectively. The Logistic Regression Model predicts \(P(y=1, | X)\), which reads as the probability that \(y\) will happen given \(X\), where \(X\) is the set
of features (see lecture notes).

## Notebook 

Heart disease is a global health threat. World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 17 million deaths occur worldwide due to [Heart disease](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases\#tab=tab\_1). Early detection of heart-disease signs can greatly help reducing the death risk. In this project, we will use Logistic Regression to predict
the overall risk of having a heart condition. The code can be found in this repository at [Logistic_Reg.ipynb](Note Book). This should teach you how to * Load, explore and pre-process a dataset * Create and evaluate A logistic regression model * Save, load, and re-use  your model
