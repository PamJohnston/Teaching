### Simple Linear Regression Model

In this tutorial, you will learn more about Linear Regression, and will learn how to train a single, and a multiple linear regression models. More specifically, this tutorial will also show you how to:

* Load dataset from a file (.csv)
* Prepare data as a set of input features and target variable (response variable) to be ready for modelling
* Create and training a linear regression model, make predictions and evaluate the model’s performance
* You will learn more about pandas, seaborn, and other Python hacks in this document
* Finally, you will learn about new tool in Python (streamlit) that allows you to create front-end easily

**Problem:** Our task for today is simple, a company is investing money in advertisements at TV, Radio and Newspaper. We want to build a model that can predict the increase of sales units, given investing certain units of money in the above media!



This repository contains the following files:

* `Regression.ipynb` Tutorial and the functional features 
* `myApp.py` For the app and it has the linear coefficients 'hard-code' (not the best way to do things, but sufficient for now)

If you follow the tutorial, you should be able to produce a simple interactive application using Streamlit, that does predictions for you. Notice, that this is not the best predictive model, and also notice that we haven’t tested it (see tutorial), but it provides a good start for learning and developing your skills.

#### Requirements 


* You need to have Python installed on your machine 
* The dataset used can be obtained from [Advertising Dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/ashydv/advertising-dataset")

* You need to have streamlit installed, if not, simply issue the following command  

```
$pip install streamlit
```
