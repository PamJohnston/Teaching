# Readme

I will be regularly updating this repository to include more tutorials on `Python` with `streamlit` for machine learning and machine vision applications. Below is an overview of available demos. Check the corresponding subfolders for more details, code, and other explanation. If you have no experience with Python programming, then you need to start [Here](Python), there is a list of resources for learning Python and relevant tools, and also a notebook with some Python code covering the basic concepts such as variables, loops, etcâ€¦
### (1) Simple Linear ModelA tutorial on linear regression using Python (basics), will teach you more python skills, and the basics of Linear Models. Also, we will use *streamlit* to build an interactive application to all interaction with the underlying models. More details can be found here [Python Intro](Python-Intro/). By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to have an application like the one below to perform simple predictions

### (2) Logistic Regression 

Logistic Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning **classification** algorithm. We used it to predict the probability that an event will occur. The response variable (what we try to
predict), is a binary variable. In other words it has two classes (i.e.~pass/ fail). Often represented as 0 and 1 respectively. The Logistic Regression Model predicts \(P(y=1, | X)\), which reads as the probability that \(y\) will happen given \(X\), where \(X\) is the set
of features (see lecture notes). Code can be found [Here](LR)
### (3) Face Recognition using SVM

This is a quick demo using SVM to recognise faces from images. It also uses `streamlit` for creating the interactive front-end features. More details at the [SVMFR](SVMFR/) repository.<br>

### (4) Symbols Classification using Random Forests 

The tutorial will focus on classification of symbols, more specifically:

* You will learn how to load, view and classify instances representing 2D images 
* Create and evaluate A Random Forest Model Classifier (Bagging ensemble-based method) using `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifie` library. Code is available here as a [Jupyter Notebook](RF/Code)
* Make predictions and visualise the results 
* Use streamlit to create an interactive front end to make predictions and view results. The python file that handles the `streamlit` part is [Here](RF/Code/streamlitApp.py). By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to produce something similar to this [Demo](https://youtu.be/5uHn9IpBmTc). You should be able to produce a solution like the one below by the end of this tutorial using Python, streamlit and relevant resources
