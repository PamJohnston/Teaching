# Readme

I will be regularly updating this repository to include more tutorials on `Python` with `streamlit` for machine learning and machine vision applications. Below is an overview of available demos. Check the corresponding subfolders for more details, code, and other explanation
### (1) Face Recognition using SVM

This is a quick demo using SVM to recognise faces from images. It also uses `streamlit` for creating the interactive front-end features. More details at the [SVMFR](SVMFR/) repository.<br>
