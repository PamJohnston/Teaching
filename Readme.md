# Readme

I will be regularly updating this repository to include more tutorials on `Python` with `streamlit` for machine learning and machine vision applications. Below is an overview of available demos. Check the corresponding subfolders for more details, code, and other explanation

### (1) Simple Linear ModelA tutorial on linear regression using Python (basics), will teach you more python skills, and the basics of Linear Models. Also, we will use *streamlit* to build an interactive application to all interaction with the underlying models. More details can be found here [Python Intro](Python-Intro/). By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to have an application like the one below to perform simple predictions

This is a quick demo using SVM to recognise faces from images. It also uses `streamlit` for creating the interactive front-end features. More details at the [SVMFR](SVMFR/) repository.<br>
